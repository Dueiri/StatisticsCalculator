Statistics module to make my class easier, I finished the class now, but I might develop this later who knows

I spent more time working on this than the homework would take.

To run this program, type
    pip install -r requirements.txt

  then, run it through python using py main.py in the directory you have it in.

Set the tokenizer type to numerical, as the other ones dont necessarily have any use yet and therefore will not work for the functions specified

This is only useful for copy and pasting random data sets that would otherwise be manually inputted into a ti-84 calculator. It uses a huggingface pretrained model to auto tokenize (separate) each data point in a string-based list. It struggles with negative numbers still, so I am learning how to create my own model to manage this rn
